# PHP Null Value Handling Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue in PHP: unexpected behavior when functions receive null values without explicit null checks.  Loose typing in PHP can lead to incorrect results or errors if null values are not handled appropriately.

The `bug.php` file shows the problematic code. The `bugSolution.php` file provides the corrected version.

**Problem:**
Functions might produce incorrect results or errors if they don't explicitly check for null values before performing operations.  The loose typing in PHP might lead to unexpected type juggling or errors.

**Solution:**
Explicitly check for null using strict comparison (`===`) before using the variable in further calculations or operations. This ensures that null values are handled correctly and prevents errors or unexpected output.
